Part 2: Compiling and Running the Program
- Save the code from Part 1 in a file called LabTest.java.
- Open the command prompt or terminal.
- Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
- Use the following commands to compile and run the program:

javac LabTest.java   # Compiles the Java file into bytecode
java LabTest         # Runs the compiled bytecode

- If everything is correct, you should see the output: The result is: 11.0.
